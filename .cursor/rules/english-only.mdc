# English only in scripts

All script and code files **must contain only English**.

- Comments, echo/print strings, error messages, and any other text in scripts must be in English.
- Do not use Chinese or other languages in the codebase.
- Exception: user-facing display names or UI strings that are intentionally localized (e.g. in config for end users) may stay in another language if required; when in doubt, use English.
- Exception: files under `rime/` (Rime input method config) may use Chinese or other languages in comments and strings; that directory is locale-specific.

## Examples

### Good (English only)

```fish
# Update version in URL when a new release is available
echo "Download failed."
```

```bash
# Install pkg to system volume
echo "Mount failed."
```

### Bad (non-English — do not use)

```fish
# 换最新版：替换下面 URL 中的版本号
echo "下载失败。"
```

```bash
# 安装 pkg 到系统卷
echo "挂载失败。"
```
